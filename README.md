From January to April in 2022, I led a UI/UX team of 2 in analyzing requirements and designing Figma mockup of National Taiwan University Student Association's website to streamline the organizationâ€™s coordination across 11 departments and communication with 30,000+ university students. The Figma mockup of the website can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/design/1iLcoGNS1waLtOROd31CAI/ntusa-official-website-mockup?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=Ueu2PfnhrgyNmUuc-0).
